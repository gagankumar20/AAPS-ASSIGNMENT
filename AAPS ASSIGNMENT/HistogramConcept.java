/*
Output:
Histogram problems involve finding areas, usually the largest rectangle in a histogram.
They are solved using stacks for efficient computation.

Explanation:
- A histogram is a graphical representation where bars of different heights represent frequencies or values.
- In algorithm design, one common histogram problem is:
  - Finding the largest rectangle under the histogram.
- Stack-based approach is typically used for optimal solutions.

Applications:
- Image processing (finding largest block of pixels)
- Histogram equalization in computer vision
- Solving matrix problems (e.g., Maximal Rectangle in a binary matrix)
- Memory allocation problems

Time Complexity (for largest rectangle problem):
O(n) - We process each bar once with the help of a stack.

Space Complexity:
O(n) - Stack space used to store bar indices.
