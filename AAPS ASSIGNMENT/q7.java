7. Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.
*/

// The Sliding Window Technique is a method where a window (subset) slides over data to solve problems efficiently.
// It's mostly used in problems like:
// - Longest substring without repeating characters
// - Maximum sum of subarrays of size k
// - Minimum window substring
// Sliding window avoids recalculating sums or states, thus optimizing brute-force approaches from O(n^2) to O(n).
